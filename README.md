# Tic Tac Toe

I've made this project following the JavaScript Full-Stack curriculum from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe">The Odin Project</a>.

Features :

- Simple 2 players Tic Tac Toe Game with score tracker

What was new ?

- Structuring the code in modules
- Using IIFE functions, keeping a cleaner global scope
- Understanding private and public scope, operating with private and public variables, methods, functions
- Using factory functions, classes and constructors, differenciating class and prototypal inheritance
